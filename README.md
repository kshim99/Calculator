** Simple calculator app using Claude.ai **

This simple calculator app was used to test the capabilities of Claude.ai from Anthropic. It started with simple arithmetic operations but the code quickly got too crowded with many functionalities. Instead, I've asked it to use a calculator API without specifying which API to use, and Claude.ai was able to implement it in a much more concise manner using MathJS calculator API. 

At request, it is able to make the user interface more colourful and user friendly, but the choice of colour palette and font were a bit questionable - they aren't bad, just not the most visually pleasing. 

Overall, Claude.ai is very helpful. It is resourceful and is able to work with API's and various python packages for UX design.
